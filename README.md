# Fully automated forex trader

My first version of a trading bot.

The trading bot is a pattern regocnition program, it identifies mayor price level breakouts and enters trades when price is returning to the mayor price level and show signs of rejection.

MQL4 programming language is very similar to C.

To test it you need to download MT4 trading platform, place the main file in the experts directory and the rest of the files in the include directory.
Start the strategy tester, choose the 15 minute timeframe and a long period for testing(atleast 6 months).
It is made for GBP/USD(Pound and Dollars) and USD/CAD(Dollar and Canadian Dollars).

Check out my MQL5 repository to see my progress on making an updated trading bot as MQL5 is very similar to C++.
